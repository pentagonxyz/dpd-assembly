# dpd-assembly
DPDâ€™s, or Decentralized Programmable Data, are a tokenized primitive for contract governed data. The DPD primitive is based on the ERC721 standard but introduces upgradability to underlying data. This data could be anything from data on-chain all the way to IPFS or Arweave instances.
Some use-case examples: token holder governed front-ends, re-creating million dollar webpage, or even a programmable oracle network.
